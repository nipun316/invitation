# invitation
The project is about a webapp which allows registeration for a party.
A server is built using python 3.8 and flask module , which uses a text document as database
.Since python contains render_template,url_for ,redirect and other useful modules ,it is preferred to php.
It has some  html ,css and javascript files that display the webpage.
U can register yourself using the site for a party,and people who are specially invited for private party can 
Enter a code,which will be checked by host from database and thereby send them details through email.
