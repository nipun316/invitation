The project is about a webapp which allows registeration for a party.
A server is built using python 3.8 and flask module , which uses a text document as database
.Since flask contains render_template,url_for ,redirect and other useful modules ,it is preferred to php.
It has some  html ,css and javascript files that display the webpage.
